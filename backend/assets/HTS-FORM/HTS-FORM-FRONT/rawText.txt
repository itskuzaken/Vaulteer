HIV TESTING
HTS
The Department of Health (DOH) has an existing program for the prevention and control of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in the
Philippines. The Epidemiology Bureau (EB) of DOH is mandated by Republic Act 11166 & 11332 to collect information that will be used in
planning activities to help stop the spread of HIV and to support and treat those diagnosed with HIV. Your full cooperation is very important
to this program. Please answer all questions as honestly as possible.
ABOUT THE TEST
What is HIV testing?
An HIV test refers to a procedure used to identify if you have antibodies to HIV - the virus that causes AIDS. A specimen, usually blood, and a DOH-Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-registered diagnostic kit is needed to perform the test. The test may be performed by a trained/supervised healthcare worker or lay person, or by
oneself, depending on the modality.
If the first test (screening) is reactive, another test (confirmatory) will be done to make sure that the first test is confirmed to be positive. A positive test means you have
been infected with HIV. A non-reactive or negative test means you are not infected or your body has not produced the sufficient level of antibodies (within window period)
that can be detected by the HIV rapid diagnostic test kits If you are non-reactive or negative, and had a recent exposure within the window period, you need to undergo
another test 4 weeks after your risk exposure.
Confidentiality of HIV Testing
Your personal information and HIV test result is confidential adherent to the provisions of RA 11166 Philippine HIV and AIDS Policy Act, RA 10173 Data Privacy Act of
2012 and its IRR of 2016
